I will show you what it looks like to not be smart, and give you a tutorial describing the steps to being in pain. So buckle up, grab a friend, and hurt yourself! (for science, of courseâ€¦)</p>

    <p>First, go to your local sporting goods store and buy a cheap baseball bat. After you have a baseball bat, you need to find a friend that is willing to hit your legs with a baseball bat. When this happens, you might get a strong feeling of pain in your legs. You might even scream because this feeling of pain is so strong. Congratulations, that concludes the first way of hurting yourself for science!</p>
